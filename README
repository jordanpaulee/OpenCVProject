Code that is not mine has had the author cited at the top of the code.
These files were pulled from open source github repos for use in the initial testing of my OpenCV project.
Some small tweaks have been made to the source code so that it runs correctly.
CODE WILL BE REFACTORED WITH MY OWN CODE SOON
